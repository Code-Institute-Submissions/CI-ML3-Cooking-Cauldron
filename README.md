# Cooking Cauldron,
The purpose of this website is to be an aid for anyone who needs it using this website will allow users to store & share recipes for Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner while offering a simple and easy
to use layout:

Finding a recipe:
- Once the user has decided which category they are looking for (Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner) they will scroll to the desired carousel (indicated by the name)
- Scroll either left or right until the desired recipe comes up

## UX:
### User stories
I'm a cooking teacher at my local secondary school and i need a place to keep recipes (besides a book) and be able to filter them for my classes.

I'm a home cook and would like a website to keep and browse recipes to see what's new and keep the classics.

### Strategy
My goal with this website is to keep is simple and easy to use dore the user by showing them everything they need and pre filtering the categories so it's easy to use,
I also like to keep the website sleek and minimalistic so the user can traverse easily.

### Scope
For the users, I want to provide them with tons of recipes without giving them too much to go wrong e.g pre filter the categorys, say who added it.

### Structure
I wanted to let the user scroll through recipes without them taking up to much screen space hence the carousel.
